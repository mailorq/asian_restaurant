command creation and outcome application

operations owns only the command lifecycle and never writes storefront state. creation is
idempotent by (actor_id, command_type, target, idempotency_key). an outcome finalises a command
from any non-terminal state, including timed_out, so a command the storefront actually applied
is never left stuck, and it closes the outbox row the confirm never closed
