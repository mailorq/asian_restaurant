"""RabbitMQ topology and publisher for order events.

Durable topology + publisher confirms + persistent messages give at-least-once
delivery with no broker-side loss. Paired with the OrderOutbox relay, an event
that cannot be confirmed stays pending and is retried.

Consumer failure handling:
  - poison message (bad payload) -> dead-lettered to the DLQ;
  - transient / out-of-order      -> delayed retry via a TTL queue, then DLQ after
    a bounded number of attempts.
